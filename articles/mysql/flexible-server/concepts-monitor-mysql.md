## Built in monitoring for Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server

Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server offers built-in resources for monitoring.

### Server logs

In Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server, users can configure and download server logs to assist with troubleshooting efforts. With this feature enabled, an Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server instance starts capturing events of the selected log type and writes them to a file. You can then use the Azure portal and Azure CLI to download the files to work with them.

The server logs feature is disabled by default. For information about how to enable server logs, see [Enable and download server logs for Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server](how-to-server-logs-portal.md)

Server logs support enabling and downloading [slow query logs](concepts-slow-query-logs.md) and [error logs](concepts-error-logs.md).
To perform a historical analysis of your data, in the Azure portal, on the Diagnostics settings pane for your server, add a diagnostic setting to send the logs to the Log Analytics workspace, Azure Storage, or event hubs. For more information, see [Set up diagnostics](./tutorial-query-performance-insights.md#set-up-diagnostics).

When logging is enabled for an Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server instance, logs are available up to seven days from their creation. If the total size of the available logs exceeds 7 GB, then the oldest files are deleted until space is available.
The 7-GB storage limit for server logs is available free of cost and can't be extended.
Logs are rotated every 24 hours or 500 MB, whichever comes first.

### Slow query logs in Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server

In Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server, the slow query log is available to users to configure and access. Slow query logs are disabled by default and can be enabled to assist with identifying performance bottlenecks during troubleshooting.

For more information about the MySQL slow query log, see the [slow query log section](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/slow-query-log.html) in the MySQL engine documentation.

#### Configure slow query logging

By default, the slow query log is disabled. To enable logs, set the `slow_query_log` server parameter to *ON*. This parameter can be configured using the Azure portal or Azure CLI.

Other parameters you can adjust to control slow query logging behavior include:

- **long_query_time**: log a query if it takes longer than `long_query_time` (in seconds) to complete. The default is 10 seconds. Server parameter `long_query_time` applies globally to all newly established connections in MySQL. However, it doesn't affect threads that are already connected. We recommended that you reconnect to Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server from the application or restart the server to clear out threads with older values of `long_query_time` and apply the updated parameter value.
- **log_slow_admin_statements**: determines if administrative statements (ex. `ALTER_TABLE`, `ANALYZE_TABLE`) are logged.
- **log_queries_not_using_indexes**: determines if queries that don't use indexes are logged.
- **log_throttle_queries_not_using_indexes**: limits the number of nonindexed queries that can be written to the slow query log. This parameter takes effect when `log_queries_not_using_indexes` is set to *ON*

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If your tables aren't indexed, setting the `log_queries_not_using_indexes` and `log_throttle_queries_not_using_indexes` parameters to **ON** might affect MySQL performance. All queries that run against these nonindexed tables are written to the slow query log.

See the MySQL [slow query log documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/slow-query-log.html) for full descriptions of the slow query log parameters.

#### Access slow query logs

Slow query logs are integrated with Azure Monitor diagnostic settings. After you enable slow query logs on your Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server instance, you can emit them to Azure Monitor logs, Event Hubs, or Azure Storage. To learn more about diagnostic settings, see the [diagnostic logs documentation](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/platform-logs-overview). To learn more about how to enable diagnostic settings in the Azure portal, see the [slow query log portal article](tutorial-query-performance-insights.md#set-up-diagnostics).

> [!NOTE]  
> Premium Storage accounts aren't supported if you're sending the logs to Azure storage via diagnostics and settings.

The following table describes the output of the slow query log. Depending on the output method, the fields included and the order in which they appear might vary.

| **Property** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `TenantId` | Your tenant ID |
| `SourceSystem` | `Azure` |
| `TimeGenerated` [UTC] | Time stamp when the log was recorded in UTC |

> For `sql_text_s`, log is truncated if it exceeds 2048 characters.

### Track database activity with Audit Logs

Azure Database for MySQL flexible server provides users with the ability to configure audit logs. Audit logs can be used to track database-level activity including connection, admin, DDL, and DML events. These types of logs are commonly used for compliance purposes.

#### Configure audit logging

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> We recommend to only log the event types and users required for your auditing purposes. This approach helps to ensure your server's performance isn't heavily affected and a minimum amount of data is collected.

By default, audit logs are disabled. To enable them, set the `audit_log_enabled` server parameter to *ON*. Enable audit logs using the Azure portal or Azure CLI.

Other parameters you can adjust to control audit logging behavior include:

- `audit_log_events`: controls the events to be logged. See the following table for specific audit events.
- `audit_log_include_users`: MySQL users to be included for logging. The default value for this parameter is empty, which includes all the users for logging. This parameter has higher priority over `audit_log_exclude_users`. Max length of the parameter is 512 characters. For example, wildcard value of `dev*` includes all the users with entries starting with keyword `dev` like *dev1,dev_user,dev_2*. Another example for wildcard entry for including user is `*dev` in this example, all users ending with value "dev" like "stage_dev,prod_dev,user_dev" are included in the audit log entries. Additionally, the use of a question mark `(?)` as a wildcard character is permitted in patterns.
- `audit_log_exclude_users`: MySQL users to be excluded from logging. The Max length of the parameter is 512 characters. Wildcard entries for user are also accepted to exclude users in audit logs. For example, wildcard value of `stage*` excludes all the users with entries starting with keyword `stage` like *stage1,stage_user,stage_2*. Another example for wildcard entry for excluding user is `*com`. In this example, all users ending with value `com` are excluded from the audit log entries. Additionally, the use of a question mark `(?)` as a wildcard character is permitted in patterns.

> [!NOTE]  
> `audit_log_include_users` has higher priority over `audit_log_exclude_users`. For example, if `audit_log_include_users` = `demouser` and `audit_log_exclude_users` = `demouser`, the user is included in the audit logs because `audit_log_include_users` has higher priority.

| **Event** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `CONNECTION` | - Connection initiation<br />- Connection termination |
| `CONNECTION_V2` | - Connection initiation (successful or unsuccessful attempt error code)<br />- Connection termination<br />|
| `DML_SELECT` | SELECT queries |
| `DML_NONSELECT` | INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE queries |
| `DML` | DML = DML_SELECT + DML_NONSELECT |
| `DDL` | Queries like "DROP DATABASE" |
| `DCL` | Queries like "GRANT PERMISSION" |
| `ADMIN` | Queries like "SHOW STATUS" |
| `GENERAL` | All in DML_SELECT, DML_NONSELECT, DML, DDL, DCL, and ADMIN |
| `TABLE_ACCESS` | - Table read statements, such as SELECT or INSERT INTO ... SELECT<br />- Table delete statements, such as DELETE or TRUNCATE TABLE<br />- Table insert statements, such as INSERT or REPLACE<br />- Table update statements, such as UPDATE |

#### Access audit logs

Audit logs are integrated with Azure Monitor diagnostic settings. After you enable audit logs on your flexible server, you can emit them to Azure Monitor logs, Azure Event Hubs, or Azure Storage.

### Use Azure Monitor workbooks

Azure Database for MySQL flexible server is now integrated with Azure Monitor workbooks. With workbooks, you get a flexible canvas for analyzing data and creating rich visual reports within the Azure portal. Workbooks allow you to tap into multiple data sources across Azure and combine them into unified interactive experiences. Workbook templates serve as curated reports that multiple users and teams design for flexible reuse.

When you open a template, you create a transient workbook that's populated with the contents of the template. With this integration, the server links to workbooks and a few sample templates, which can help you monitor the service at scale. You can edit these templates, customize them to your requirements, and pin them to the dashboard to create a focused and organized view of Azure resources.

Azure Database for MySQL flexible server has three available templates:

- **Overview**: Displays an instance summary and top-level metrics to help you visualize and understand the resource utilization on your server. This template displays the following views:

  - Server Summary
  - Database Summary
  - Connection Metrics
  - Performance Metrics
  - Storage Metrics

- **Auditing**: Displays a summary and details of the auditing events that are collected for the server. This template displays the following views:

  - Administrative Actions on the service
  - Audit Summary
  - Audit Connection Events Summary
  - Audit Connection Events
  - Table Access Summary
  - Errors Identified

- **Query Performance Insight**: Displays a summary and details of query workload on the instance, long running query, slow query analysis, and connection metrics. This template displays the following views:

  - Query Load
  - Total Active Connections
  - Slow Query Trend (>10 seconds of query time)
  - Slow Query Details
  - List top five longest queries
  - Summarize slow queries by minimum, maximum, average, and standard deviation query time

You can also edit and customize these templates according to your requirements. For more information, see [Azure Workbooks](/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview).

#### Access the workbook templates

To view the templates in the Azure portal, go to the **Monitoring** pane for Azure Database for MySQL flexible server, and then select **Workbooks**.
