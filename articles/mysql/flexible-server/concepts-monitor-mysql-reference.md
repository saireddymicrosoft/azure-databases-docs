### Troubleshoot metrics

Sometimes, you might encounter issues with creating, customizing, or interpreting charts in Azure Metrics Explorer.

A *Chart showing no data* could arise due to various factors. These issues might include the Microsoft Insights resource provider not being registered for your subscription or you lacking adequate access rights to your Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server. Other possibilities could be that your resource didn't generate metrics within the chosen time frame or the selected time range exceeds 30 days.

Several reasons that follow can cause this behavior:

- *Microsoft.Insights resource provider isn't registered*: Exploring metrics requires Microsoft.Insights resource provider registered in your subscription. Register your server manually by following the steps described in [Azure resource providers and types](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types).
- *Insufficient access rights to your resource*: Ensure you have sufficient permissions for your Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server from which you're exploring metrics. Your resource didn't emit metrics during the selected time range. Change the time of the chart to a wider range. In Azure, [Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)](/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) controls access to metrics. You must be a member of [monitoring reader](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#monitoring-reader), [monitoring contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#monitoring-contributor), or [contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#contributor) to explore metrics for any resource.
- *Your resource didn't emit metrics during the selected time range*: This behavior could be due to several reasons. One possibility is that your resource didn't generate metrics within the chosen time frame. Change the time of the chart to a broader range to see if this approach resolves the issue. For more detailed information on troubleshooting this issue, refer to the [Azure Monitor metrics troubleshooting guide](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-troubleshoot#your-resource-didnt-emit-metrics-during-the-selected-time-range).
- *Time range greater than 30 days*: Verify that the difference between the start and end dates in the time picker doesn't exceed the 30-day interval. For more detailed information on troubleshooting metrics, refer to the [Azure Monitor metrics troubleshooting guide](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-troubleshoot).
- *Dashed Line Indication*: In Azure Monitor, a dashed line signifies a gap in data, or a *null value*, between two points of known time grain data. This aspect is a deliberate design that helps detect missing data points. If your chart displays dashed lines, it indicates missing data. For more information, see [Chart shows dashed line](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-troubleshoot#chart-shows-dashed-line).
